# FileSpoofer

Simple program to spoof file extensions and icons.

**Warning: The program you are trying to spoof may start to change its name randomly (with a .tmp extension). That is the Windows defenders' fault, and you will most likely see a pop-up message in your bottom right corner. To fix this, you can either disable Windows defender (not recommended) or whitelist the program.**

More file extensions have identical functionalities to the .exe extension, namely .scr and .com. In FileSpoofer, you can choose between these extensions, making your names and programs (malware) seem extremely authentic. Many people know about the right-to-left override character and are thus very aware of this attack. Most people do, however, not know about .com and .scr and their identical functionality to .exe. Even regular computer users get suspicious of the exe ending, as there are not many words (if any) ending with exe. The .jar (java files) could also be a possibility, though not added yet.

Below is a picture of some decently creative spoof names I came up with:

(you apparently can't change .com file icons)

Adding new icons is extremely easy. Simply add the icon in the icons folder with the name of the extension. Meaning, if you have an 'exe' icon, name it 'exe.ico' and put it in the folder.
